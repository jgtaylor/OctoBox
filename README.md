## Important
This is a kind of temporary hack that will likely be whole re-factored, if not entirely rewritten. The goal is to prototype the "device" side, or the Microcontroler side while fleshing out the general API to be used with the Flow infrastructure. To that end, there will be a stub server that will provide the app logic for the time being.

It's the device stuff that important - network devices for everything!
